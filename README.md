# Scantron-Process-App
This was my first year final project in introduction to Computer Science course. The application allows a user to process their scantron sheet for an exam, and it displays mulitple different information about the data received. It could tell you the highest score, what the hardest question was and even illustrates the data in a bar char using python turtle.
